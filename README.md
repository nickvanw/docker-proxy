docker-proxy
============

Docker proxy is a reverse proxy for Docker containers that allows the load balancing of multiple sites. It's not a unique idea - there are many clones, but I found myself wanting a few things from the majority that I saw:

* More introspection into the current websites and containers
* Prodcution stability
* More flexible virtual host configuration

Many of the ideas were taken from [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy), which is the leading project. Unfortunately, there were many edge cases and bugs when I attempted to use it, and I did not have the level of introspection that I wanted.

The project is currently a work in progress, but PRs are always welcome, as well as Issues/Feature Requests.
